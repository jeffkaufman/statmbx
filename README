  statmbx allows you to see what unread messages you have in your
  mailbox without opening an email client.  It is written in C and
  runs as quickly as is possible without indexing.  Compatible with
  mutt, pine, and any other mail program storing messages in the mbox
  format: http://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html
